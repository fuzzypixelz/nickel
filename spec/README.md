# Nickel Language Specification

This directory hosts the specifications of different parts of the Nickel core
language. It is currently limited to ongoing work on the type system and the
typechecking algorithm, but is intended to eventually cover syntax and the
operational semantics (including merging and contracts). As opposed to RFCs or
other kind of technical documentation, specifications don't include motivation
or justification for specific features, but are extensive and usually formal
descriptions of the current model of the language.
